# Tests for using Machine Learning to improve performance of Go programs
This project contains some tests belonging to [this blog post](https://blog.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/index.php/2019/02/28/about-using-machine-learning-to-improve-performance-of-go-programs/) about learning the sizes arrays, slices or maps are going to reach using Machine Learning (ML) to increase  programsâ€™ performances by allocating the necessary memory in advance instead of reallocating every time new elements are appended.
